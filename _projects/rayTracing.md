title: "Monto Carlo Ray Tracer"
short: "MCMT"
collection: projects
excerpt: 
keypoints: 
    - 'Implemented CPU-based Monte Carlo path tracer in C++, with various BSDFs(Materials), various lights.' 
    - 'Integrated Multiple importance sampling to make the Monte Carlo estimator have a lower variance for a broad class of integrands.'
    - 'Used BVH as an acceleration structure that speeded up the rendering time almost 100 times.'
    - 'Used multi-threading to paralleled the computing for rays.'
