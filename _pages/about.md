<hr>
My name is Hongbo Li, a graduated Master student from University of Texas, Dallas, supervised by Prof. [Xiaohu Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/) and Prof. [Feng Chen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~fxc190007/). My research work during the master program mainly focused on applying deep learning techniques on 3D face reconstruction and deepfake image detection.

I have a passion for creating things, and programming is a very powerful tool to do that. Programming is fundamentally about creating solutions to problems. “It’s the sheer joy of making things” quote from “The Mythical Man-Month” by Fred Brooks.

My main interest is in computer graphics, especially in rendering. I have read and implemented several graphics projects including rendering and animation. Check my project page for more information.
