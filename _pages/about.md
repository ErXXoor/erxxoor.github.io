My name is Hongbo Li. I am now working as a Graphics engineer. I have received a Master's degree in computer science from the University of Texas, Dallas in 2021, supervised by Prof. Xiaohu Guo and Prof. Feng Chen. My research work during the master's program mainly focused on applying deep learning techniques to 3D face reconstruction and deepfake image detection.

I have a passion for creating things, and programming is a very powerful tool to do that. Programming is fundamentally about creating solutions to problems. “It’s the sheer joy of making things” quote from “The Mythical Man-Month” by Fred Brooks.

My main interest is in computer graphics, especially in geometry processing and rendering. I have read and implemented several graphics projects during my spare time. Check my project page for more information.
